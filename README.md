## Setup
To setup dependenices, install `pipenv` and run `pipenv sync`. You might want to run `export PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=true` first to create the `virtualenv` in the project folder. You can then activate the virtual environment with `pipenv shell`.
* `python manage.py migrate` to create a new database.
* `python manage.py createsuperuser` will let you create a new user to use the admin panel for testing.
* `python manage.py runserver` to start a local server.
* `flake8` to lint with `flake8`.
* `pylint_runner` to check for code style and other errors statically with `pylint` in all files.

It is recommended to set up your IDE with both `pylint` and `flake8`, since these will cause the CircleCI build to fail. Google's [Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) is followed upto a certain extent in all modules.

## Running Tests
Tests can be run in two configurations:
### Without Celery
This is the recommended and default configuration, and should suffice for all developmental purposes except if you are working with async tasks or notifications. Simply use `python manage.py test --settings backend.settings_test` to run automated tests.
### With Celery
This is the default configuration for `full-test` GitHub builds. To test under this configuration, start a local PostgresQL and RabbitMQ server, and an instance of celery in background with `celery -A backend worker --pool=solo -l info`. Once celery is processing background tasks, you can run tests as `python manage.py test --settings backend.settings_test --keepdb`, ensuring that the database `test_instiapp` is created in postgres beforehand. The following environment variables must be set:
* `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` to `backend.settings_test`
* `NO_CELERY` to `false`
### FTS
Full-Text Search is implemented with [Sonic](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic). To set up, install `cargo` and `sonic` and start it on `localhost`. Then set the `USE_SONIC` setting to `True`.

## Documentation
Autogenerated OpenAPI specification can be accessed at `http://server/api/docs/` (or at the [official deployment](https://insti.app/api/docs/))

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome, but make sure the following criteria are satisfied
* If you are (possibly) breaking an existing feature, state this explicitly in the PR description
* Commit messages should be in present tense, descriptive and relevant, closely following the [GNOME Commit Message Guidelines](https://wiki.gnome.org/Git/CommitMessages). Adding a tag to the message is optional (for now). Commits should not have git tags unless they indicate a version change.
* Documentation should be updated when the API is modified
* All required status checks must pass. Barring exceptional cases, relevant tests should be added/updated whenever necessary.
* Barring exceptional cases, Codacy should not report any new issues
* Follow the general style of the project. Badly written or undocumented code might be rejected
* If you are proposing a new model or modifications to an existing one, create an issue first, explaining why it is useful
* Outdated, unsupported or closed-source libraries should not be used
* Be nice!
